* **file**0-positive_or_negative.c - program that assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed

>variable n will store a different value each time it is executed
>Output of the program should be:
>> If the number is greater than 0: is positive
>> If the number is 0: is zero
>> If the number is less than zero: is negative
>>>source code provided [here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_c)

* **file**1-last_digit.c - assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

>> source code provided [here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_c)

* **file**2-print_alphabet.c - prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

>>only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etcâ€¦) is forbidden)
>>only use putchar twice in your code. All your code should be in the main functions

* **file**3-print_alphabets.c - prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

>>only use the putchar function three times in code

* **file**4-print_alphabt.c - prints the alphabet in lowercase excluding q and e, followed by a new line.

>> only putchar function to be used twice (printf and puts not allowed).

* **file**5-print_numbers.c - prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
* **file**6-print_numberz.c - prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

>>only putchar function to be used twice (printf and puts not allowed).

* **file**7-print_tebahpla.c - prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.

>>only putchar function to be used twice (printf and puts not allowed).

* **file**8-print_base16.c - prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.

>>only putchar function to be used thrice (printf and puts not allowed).

* **file**9-print_comb.c - program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

>>only putchar function to be used four times max in code (printf and puts not allowed).
>>Numbers must be separated by , followed by a space
>>Numbers should be printed in ascending order
>>Not allowed to use any variable of type char

* **file**100-print_comb3.c

>>only putchar function to be used five times maximmum. (printf and puts not allowed).
>>Not allowed to use any variable of type char

* **file**101-print_comb4.c - prints all possible different combinations of three digits

>>Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
>>The three digits must be different
>>*012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the three digits 0, 1 and 2*
>>Print only the smallest combination of three digits
>>Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with three digits
>>not allowed to use any variable of type char

* **file**102-print_comb5.c - prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers

>>The numbers should range from 0 to 99
>>The two numbers should be separated by a space
>>All numbers should be printed with two digits. 1 should be printed as 01
>>The combination of numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
>>The combinations of numbers should be printed in ascending order
>>*00 01 and 01 00 are considered as the same combination of the numbers 0 and 1*
