# pointers, arrays and strings

## Resources to read/watch

>> * **pointers and arrays**- Read [here](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/60)
>> * **data structures**- Read[here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/data_structures_basics.htm) on Tutorials point and [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/) on Geeksforgeeks

* **file** 0-reset_to_98.c- takes a pointer to an int as parameters and updates the value it points to to 98
* **file** 1-swap.c - function that swaps the values of two integers
* **file** 2-strlen.c - returns the length of a string
* **file** 3-puts.c - prints a string followed by anew line to stdout

>> * standard library provides a similar function puts. Run `man

* **file** 4-print_rev.c - prints a string in reverse followed by a new line
* **file** 5-rev_string.c - reverses a string
* **file** 6-puts2.c - prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character followed by a new line
* **file** 7-puts_half.c - prints the half of a string followed by a new line

>> * function should print second half of a string
>> * If the numbers of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string , where n = length_of_string -1) /2

* **file** 8-print_array.c - prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line

>> * Prototype: void print_array(int *a, int n);
>> * where n is the number of elements of the array to be printed
>> * Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
>> * The numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array

* **file** 9-strcpy.c - copies the string pointed to by src including the terminating null byte (\0) to the buffer pointed to by dest

>> * Return value: the pointer to dest

* **file** 100-atoi.c - convert a string to an integer

>> * You need to take into account all the - and + signs before number
>> * If there are no numbers in the string, the function must return 0

* **file** 101-keygen.c - generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme man srand,rand,time
