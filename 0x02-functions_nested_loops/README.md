# Functions_nested_loops

* **file** 0-putchar.c
* **file** 1-alphabet.c - prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

>> * Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);

* **file** 2-print_alphabet_x10.c - prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

>> * Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);

* **file** 3-islower.c - checks for lowercase character.

>> * Prototype: int _islower(int c);

* **file** 4-isalpha.c - checks for alphabetic character.
* **file** 5-sign.c - prints the sign of a number.
* **file** 6-abs.c - computes the absolute value of an integer.

>> * The standard library provides a similar function: abs. Run man abs to learn more.

* **file** 7-print_last_digit.c - function that prints the last digit of a number.
* **file** 8-24_hours.c - function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
* **file** 9-times_table.c - function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
* **file** 10-add.c - function that adds two integers and returns the result.
* **file** 11-print_to_98.c - function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.

>> * Prototype: void print_to_98(int n);
>> * Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space
>> * Numbers should be printed in order
>> * The first printed number should be the number passed to your function
>> * The last printed number should be 98

* **file** 100-times_table.c - prints the n times table, starting with 0.

>> * Prototype: void print_times_table(int n);
>> * If n is greater than 15 or less than 0 the function should not print anything

* **file** 101-natural.c - program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line
* **file** 102-fibonacci.c - program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.

>> *The numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space ,

* **file** 103-fibonacci.c - program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms, followed by a new line by considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000,
* **file** 104-fibonacci.c - program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.

>> * The numbers should be separated by comma, followed by a space ,
>> * You are not allowed to use any other library (You can’t use GMP etc…)
>> * You are not allowed to use long long, malloc, pointers, arrays/tables, or structures
>> * You are not allowed to hard code any Fibonacci number (except for 1 and 2)
