* **file** 0-isupper.c - checks for uppercase character
* **file** 1-isdigit.c - function that checks for a digit (0 through 9)
* **file** 2-mul.c - multiplies two integers
* **file** 3-print_numbers.c - prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line
* **file** 4-print_most_numbers.c - prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line

>> * Do not print 2 and 4

* **file** 5-more_numbers.c - prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line
* **file** 6-print_line.c - draws a straight line in the terminal
* **file** 7-print_diagonal.c - draws a diagonal line on the terminal
* **file** 8-print_square.c - prints a square, followed by a new line.

>> * Use the character # to print the square

* **file** 9-fizz_buzz.c - prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

>> * Each number or word should be separated by a space

* **file** 10-print_triangle.c - prints a triangle, followed by a new line

>> * If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line
>> * Use the character # to print the triangle

* **file**100-prime_factor.c - prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.
* **file** 101-print_number.c - prints an integer
